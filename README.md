## Hi there 👋

📚 I am a senior Mathematics Major with Computer Science and Data Science Minors at Washington and Lee University.

🔭 I’m currently working on graduate school and job applications as well as learning more about Software Development in my computer science class!

🌱 I’m also learning more about Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, and Social Networks in my other classes.

🏃‍♀️ My favorite hobby is running, but I also enjoy going on hikes and playing soccer.

👩‍🏫 I also love teaching and mentoring elementary and middle school students.

⚡ Three fun facts about me are: I don't like chocolate, I ran a half marathon and am hoping to run a full marathon and a triathlon in the future, and my sister is my best friend!
